            Welcome to SCI Virtual Dashboard for Equipment Management and
            Inventory
          </h2>
          <p>
            This dashboard simplifies the process of finding and reserving
            equipment and rooms within the School of Computing and Information.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            The School of Information Sciences, the Department of Computer
            Science, and the Intelligent Systems Program joined forces to
            establish the School of Computing and Information (SCI) in 2017.
            This merger aimed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and
            innovation within the field of computing and information. However,
            as the SCI continued to evolve, the challenges of managing equipment
            and room reservations became apparent. Currently, the SCI operates
            with two separate legacy systems, which pose inefficiencies in
            equipment and room management. Navigating the campus and locating
            specific buildings, such as Sennott Square, the Information Science
            building, and Bellefield, can also be a challenge for students,
            faculty, and staff. The need for a cohesive and user-friendly
            solution to address these issues is clear. The proposed project, the
            "SCI Virtual Dashboard for Equipment Management and Inventory," is
            designed to bridge these gaps and provide a streamlined, efficient
            solution for equipment and room reservations, ultimately enhancing
            the overall user experience within the SCI department.
