      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The School of Information Sciences, the Department of Computer
        Science, and the Intelligent Systems Program joined forces to
        establish the School of Computing and Information (SCI) in 2017.
        This merger aimed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and
        innovation within the field of computing and information. However,
        as the SCI continued to evolve, the challenges of managing equipment
        and room reservations became apparent. Currently, the SCI operates
        with two separate legacy systems, which pose inefficiencies in
        equipment and room management. Navigating the campus and locating
        specific buildings, such as Sennott Square, the Information Science
        building, and Bellefield, can also be a challenge for students,
        faculty, and staff. The need for a cohesive and user-friendly
        solution to address these issues is clear. The proposed project, the
        "SCI Virtual Dashboard for Equipment Management and Inventory," is
        designed to bridge these gaps and provide a streamlined, efficient
        solution for equipment and room reservations, ultimately enhancing
        the overall user experience within the SCI department.
